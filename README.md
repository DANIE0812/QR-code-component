# Frontend Mentor - QR code component

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Worked on the QR-code component challenge on Frontend Mentor. This was very existing and my first front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, a basic understanding of HTML and CSS was required.**

## Overview
### The challenge

The challenge was to build out a QR code component and get it looking as close to the mobile and desktop design in the starter kit provided.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned
- Using a level-one heading (h1) even though it wasn't a full-page challenge. I  created an h1 element within the main element that was hidden visually but visible and readable by screen readers. The class sr-only hid the content visually.

- Don't skip heading levels; Always start from h1, followed by h2, and so on up to h6 (h1,h2,...,h6). 

- If the image is not a decoration like in the case of this project, it must have an alt attribute. The alt attribute should explain its purpose.

- Instead of using pixels in font-size, used relative units (em or rem). The font-size in absolute units like pixels does not scale with the user's browser settings. This can cause accessibility issues for users who have set their browser to use a larger font size.

Code snippets:

```html
<h1 class="sr-only">QR Card Component</h1>
```
```css
.sr-only:not(:focus):not(:active) {
    clip: rect(0 0 0 0); 
    clip-path: inset(50%);
    height: 1px;
    overflow: hidden;
    position: absolute;
    white-space: nowrap; 
    width: 1px;
}
```
